# Monolithic vs Micro-Services

  **Challenges of Monolithic Architecture:**

- **Inflexible –** Monolithic applications cannot be built using different technologies 
- **Unreliable –** Even if one feature of the system does not work, then the entire system does not work
- **Unscalable –** Applications cannot be scaled easily since each time the application needs to be updated, the complete system has to be rebuilt
- **Blocks Continous Development –** Many features of the applications cannot be built and deployed at the same time
- **Slow Development –** Development in monolithic applications take lot of time to be built since each and every feature has to be built one after the other
- **Not Fit For Complex Applications –** Features of complex applications have tightly coupled dependencies
