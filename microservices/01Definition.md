**Microservices** - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.

## Martin Fowler Definition

 **\*Microservice architectural style*** is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are **built around business capabilities** and **independently deployable** by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a **bare minimum of centralized management** of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
